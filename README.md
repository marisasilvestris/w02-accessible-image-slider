## Requirements checklist

🟠 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).  
🟠 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).  
🟠 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.  
🟢 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

### Stretch requirements

🔴 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.  
🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.  
🟢 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.  
🏹 As as self-imposed challenge to improve my weak knowledge of JS, I'd like to make it reusable and dependent on only one "setup" HTML element

## Reflection

okay goofballs let's spin y'all a tale of ultimate hubris and nefarious scope creep, 'cause ya gal's got some terrible practices and mistakes to admit to.
