### w02-accessible-image-slider TODO

> Implement touch events for swiping hero image  
> Fix busted-looking mobile view  
> Prevent thumbnail slider moving with arrow key presses when focused?  
> But also moving the slider intentionally when the next/prev image is out of frame
> Peel out the win95 theming and turn both that and the image gallery itself into something reusable?
> Add quick launch buttons, basically a repeat of the task bar buttons. I could genericise the button insertion to handle most of the start bar gubbins and save some redundancy, but I simply cannot be bothered. That seems hard and boring!
